# JoCo-8SX Hardware Test
Ongoing 65C02 assembly project to test hardware and peripheral interfaces for my homebrew 6502 computer.

This project is almost obsolete, as it has been a stepping stone toward a 65C816 homebrew project.  This repo is to test hardware and peripheral development on a known good, pretty damn solid 65C02 homebrew computer.  Much of this code will be reused in the kernal/OS for my '816 build.
